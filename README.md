# Monte-Carlo-Simulations-FreqvsBayes
A look at the coverage and mean squared errors of a Bayesian and Frequentist approach to predicting probabilities.

## Introduction:
Goal: Compare frequentist and Bayesian methods for estimating a binomial proportion. To do so, I will look at the mean squared error of the point estimators from each approach to see how accurately it estimates the true (known) probability. Next, I will plot the coverage of the corresponding interval estimators, measuring how often those intervals successfully contain the true value. The goal here is to estimate the accuracy and effectiveness of these estimators in different conditions. Then, compare them to each other.
